The file `matbench_demo.py` can be used to fetch Matbench formation energy dataset.
The file `predict_energy_batch.py` can be used to obtain batch inference of GNN model.
The file `augment_from_file_uniform.py` can be used to augment the dataset with controlled perturbation without affecting the energy labels.
The file `augment_from_file_modelmapped_uniform.py` can be used to augment the dataset with controlled perturbation while using an existing model to generate energy labels.
