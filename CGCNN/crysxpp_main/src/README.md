1. Follow https://github.com/txie-93/cgcnn for training CGCNN model.
2. Use `predict_energy_holdout_unrelaxed.py` to predict energy of holdout unrelaxed structures (as mentioned in manuscript).
3. Use `analyze_holdout_unrelaxed.py` to compute (Metric)<sub>1</sub> and (Metric)<sub>2</sub> as mentioned in manuscript.
